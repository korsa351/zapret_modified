censor's DNS can return equal result for multiple blocked domains.
all resolved IPs are unique
-- DNS looks good
-- NOTE this check is Russia targeted. In your country other domains may be blocked.
* checking virtualization

NOTE ! this test should be run with zapret or any other bypass software disabled, without VPN

specify domain(s) to test. multiple domains are space separated.
domain(s) (default: rutracker.org) : ip protocol version(s) - 4, 6 or 46 for both (default: 46) : 
check http (default : Y) (Y/N) ? 
check https tls 1.2 (default : Y) (Y/N) ? 
TLS 1.3 uses encrypted ServerHello. DPI cannot check domain name in server response.
This can allow more bypass strategies to work.
What works for TLS 1.2 will also work for TLS 1.3 but not vice versa.
Most sites nowadays support TLS 1.3 but not all. If you can't find a strategy for TLS 1.2 use this test.
TLS 1.3 only strategy is better than nothing.
check https tls 1.3 (default : N) (Y/N) ? 
make sure target domain(s) support QUIC or result will be negative in any case
check http3 QUIC (default : Y) (Y/N) ? 
on limited systems like openwrt CA certificates might not be installed to preserve space
in such a case curl cannot verify server certificate and you should either install ca-bundle or disable verification
however disabling verification will break https check if ISP does MitM attack and substitutes server certificate
do not verify server certificate (default : N) (Y/N) ? 
sometimes ISPs use multiple DPIs or load balancing. bypass strategies may work unstable.
how many times to repeat each test (default: 1) : 
quick - scan as fast as possible to reveal any working strategy
standard - do investigation what works on your DPI
force - scan maximum despite of result
1 : quick
2 : standard
3 : force
your choice (default : standard) : selected : standard

Please note this SUMMARY does not guarantee a magic pill for you to copy/paste and be happy.
Understanding how strategies work is very desirable.
This knowledge allows to understand better which strategies to prefer and which to avoid if possible, how to combine strategies.
Blockcheck does it's best to prioritize good strategies but it's not bullet-proof.
It was designed not as magic pill maker but as a DPI bypass test tool.
